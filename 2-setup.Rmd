If you wish to follow along, make sure you have:  
1. Downloaded R: https://cloud.r-project.org/  
2. Downloaded RStudio Desktop (Open Source License FREE): https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/  
3. Downloaded these workshop materials: https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/RStudio-Project-Management  

Once your RStudio environment is setup, run the below code manually to ensure that you have the necessary packages installed if you wish to follow along and/or use RStudio to manage your own projects. 

> NOTE: this is still under construction and might or might not work for you during this pilot workshop...

```{r}
# List of packages we will use. 
packages = c("rmarkdown", "knitr", "ggplot2", "glmnet")

# Try to load each package and save the result.
success = sapply(packages, require, character.only = T, quietly = T)

# Check if any packages still need to be installed.
if (sum(!success) > 0) {
  
  # Install any needed packages.
  install.packages(packages[!success])
  
  # Load the newly installed packages.
  sapply(packages[!success], require, character.only = T, quietly = T)
}

# Clean up variables.
rm(packages, success)
```
