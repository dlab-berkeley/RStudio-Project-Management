# Markdown

Fancy text formatting! Prepare documents that directly link to your code and vice-versa. 

#### .html

After you create the .html file, double click it with your mouse and it will open in your preferred web browser. 

## Stylizing text

Enter text by typing normally. Use hashtage to change the header size, and **wrap words in double stars** to bold text. __Wrap them in underscores__ to italicize them! 

Headers can be created by placing one hashtag, two hashtags, etc. before your text.

## Example
