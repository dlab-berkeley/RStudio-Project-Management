# Markdown
Fancy text formatting! Prepare documents that directly link to your code and vice-versa. 


## Stylizing text
Enter text by typing normally. Use hashtage to change the header size, and **wrap words in double stars** to bold text. __Wrap them in underscores__ to italicize them! 

Headers can be created by placing one hashtag, two hashtags, etc. before your text. 

## Images
You can include images, sound, video, etc.

## knitr
If you successfully installed knitr, you should see a button called "Knit" at the top of your script complete with needle and yarn. Click the drop-down menu and select "Knit to HTML". 

After you create the .html file, double click it with your mouse and it will open in your preferred web browser.
