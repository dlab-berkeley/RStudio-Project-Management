- Research Design

- Data Methods and Tools

- Document Preparation

- Presentation

- Organization, and

- Preparation

## Research Design
Before all of the tech stuff, it usually helps to get your project off the ground by flexing your domain expertise. Don't skip the design basics!

## Data Methods and Tools
Be sure to also consider data methods and tools in the design of your research - this can save you time, energy, and stress as your results and discussion depend on your broader research framework.

## Virtual Machines
Do you need to run a particular version of a program? Learn more about: 

[Academic Environments on Demand:](http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/analytics-environments-demand) "Researchers need easy access to analytic computing environments that are designed to fit their needs. BRC's Analytics Environments on-Demand (AEoD) service is designed for researchers who need to run analytic software packages (such as ArcGIS, Stata, SPSS, R Studio, etc.) on a platform that is scaled up from a standard laptop or workstation, in a Windows-based environment."

[Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) open source, professional virtual machine for home or enterprise use. 

## Containers 
You might also need to package these version configurations as reproducible environments along with your data and code as "containers". 

What is a container? "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings".
